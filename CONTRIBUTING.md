## Ways to Contribute

### Report Bugs

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help by submitting an issue to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/seesmof/twitch-ai-chatbot). Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

### Suggest Enhancements

You can also contribute by suggesting new features or enhancements to improve the bot. Submit an issue explaining your idea and start a discussion around it.

### Add Personas

The bot uses personas to take on different characters. You can easily add new personas by following the guide in [personas.py](personas.py). Try creating some fun new personas for the bot!

### Improve Documentation

Good documentation is crucial for any open source project. You can make edits to docs like the README to be more clear and helpful.

### Submit Bug Fixes or Features

For larger contributions, first open an issue and discuss your idea. This will allow coordination and avoid duplicate work. Then you can submit a Pull Request that addresses the issue. PRs will be reviewed and merged once requirements are met.
